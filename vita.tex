I'm a Lecturer and a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science under Charles Isbell. I completed my MS in Computer Science in 2004 specializing in Artificial Intelligence. A 1990 graduate of the United States Air Force Academy, my background includes research, software engineering, flying, and teaching -- as a classroom instructor and as an instructor pilot. During my 13 years as a professional software engineer in private industry, the military, and applied research, I built and delivered dozens of successful enterprise-scale and single-user systems, mostly as chief architect or lead software engineer. As a researcher, I have applied machine learning to text analysis, radio emmiter identification, automated antenna design, and adaptive agent technology. I am currently focused on basic research to enable the engineering of robust, large-scale intelligent agent software. To this end I am creating an experimental programming language that represents a new adaptive agent paradigm. AFABL (A Friendly Adaptive Behavior Language) integrates reinforcement learning into a Scala-based domain-specific language which makes certain kinds of agent programs less complex to write and understand.
