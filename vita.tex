Christopher Simpkins is a Lecturer in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He completed his MS in Computer Science in 2004 specializing in Artificial Intelligence. A 1990 graduate of the United States Air Force Academy, his background includes research, software engineering, flying, and teaching -- as a classroom instructor and as an instructor pilot. During 15 years as a professional software engineer in private industry, the military, and applied research, he built and delivered dozens of successful enterprise-scale and single-user systems, mostly as chief architect or lead software engineer. As a researcher, he has applied machine learning to text analysis, radio emmiter identification, automated antenna design, and adaptive agent technology. He is currently focused on basic research to enable the engineering of robust, large-scale intelligent agent software. To this end he is creating an experimental programming language that represents a new adaptive agent paradigm. AFABL (A Friendly Adaptive Behavior Language) integrates reinforcement learning into a Scala-based domain-specific language which makes certain kinds of agent programs less complex to write and understand.
