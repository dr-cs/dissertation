I have taken a long and difficult road to this Ph.D., which would not have been possible without the generous support of many wonderful people. My family has been very patient with their absentee husband and father, and my committee has been patient and helpful as I have juggled full time work, research, writing, and family.

I started my Ph.D. journey over a decade ago while working at Georgia Tech Research Institute. Ashwin Ram, my first advisor, guided me through the application process and gave me my first research opportunities. Sheila Isbell connected me to the right lab at GTRI, ITTL (now ICL), which better fit my background and aspirations. Terry Hilderbrand and Margaret Loper were instrumental in helping me access the generous support offered to Ph.D. students and supporting me as I balanced my GTRI duties with doctoral studies.

Charles Isbell accepted me as his student just when I needed him. Becoming Charles's student was invigorating, and his graduate students were as warm as they were brilliant. My children have as many fond memories of my lab mates as I do. My work builds on the earlier work of my lab mate and friend, Sooraj Bhat. Sooraj helped me get started in language-integrated reinforcement learning and fueled my interest in advanced programming languages.

I did most of my writing during the Fall 2016 semester. During that time my CS 1331 head TA, Taylor Hartman, took on a great deal of responsibility to allow me more time to write. CS 1331 could not have functioned as well as it did without her leadership and the groundwork laid by past TAs and Head TAs -- Keith Cartledge, Thomas Shields, Aaron Friesen, and Stefano Fenu.

I am especially grateful to my advisor, Charles Isbell, for supporting me through years of struggle. No matter how difficult the challenges seemed or how likely it seemed that I would fail, Charles always told me he believed I could finish. I am relieved to have proven him right.

Finally I want to acknowledge my wife, Caroline, who met me before I passed my qualifer, and shortly after I became a full-time single father. She has endured years of being a ``Ph.D. widow'' while taking on the role of stepmother and helped me in a million small and not so small ways as I struggled to supported a yound family in distress. No matter how discouraged I became, no matter how sullen my mood, every time our eyes met she smiled sincerely. It is impossible to overstate how reassuring such a seemingly small gesture can be. I would not be here without Caroline.
